# ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! Whether it's reporting a bug,
discussing improvements, or submitting a pull request, every bit of help is
valuable.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <your-fork-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```

    or for bug fixes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-or-description
    ```

4. **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and style guidelines (e.g., run linters/formatters if provided).
5. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work as expected and do not break existing functionality. Add new tests if you are introducing new features.
6. **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Follow conventional commit formats if the project uses them.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Implement the amazing feature" -m "Detailed description of the feature, why it's needed, and how it works."
    ```

7. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```

8. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original project repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Target the appropriate branch (usually `main`, `master`, or `develop`).
    *   Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes in the PR. Explain the problem your PR solves and the approach you took.
    *   Link any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Ensure any CI checks pass.
