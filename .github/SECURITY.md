When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

* **Confirmation:** We will confirm the vulnerability and determine its potential impact.
* **Fix:** We will develop a fix for the vulnerability.
* **Release:** We will release a patch or new version of `depman` that includes the fix.
* **Disclosure:** After the release, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability, crediting the reporter if they wish. The timeline for disclosure will be coordinated with the reporter.

We aim to handle disclosures responsibly and will not disclose vulnerabilities prematurely. We may ask you to keep the vulnerability confidential until we have released a fix.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the latest released version of `depman` and any actively maintained branches. If you are unsure whether a vulnerability is in scope, please report it anyway.

The following types of issues are generally considered out of scope (though we appreciate reports if you believe they represent a significant risk):

* Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report these to the respective projects).
* Denial of service attacks that require significant resources.
* Social engineering or phishing attacks.
* Reports from automated vulnerability scanners without manual verification or a clear proof-of-concept.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
